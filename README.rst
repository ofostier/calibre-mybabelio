Scraps metadata from Babelio database and updates the metadata in the calibre library.

Inspired and copied from Calibre Babelio plugin and Calibre Comic Vine Scraper project

Can run without Calibre installation throught docker container

.. warning::
    Only update metadata when only one book match with babelio db
